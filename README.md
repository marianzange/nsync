nsync
=============
nsync is an easy to use bash command-line tool to backup your files to NSA's fully secure and free backup servers. Here's some news coverage about NSA's free PRISM backup program: https://medium.com/surveillance-state/a6e0e5fca935

How to backup data
-------------
Backing up data is very simple. Just run `./nsync targetfolder` and your files will be automatically compressed and sent to NSA. Currently the backup endpoint is set to NSA's public affairs office. In reality the endpoint does not matter. Changing it to your mom's email address won't affect the backup process.

How to restore your data
-------------
NSA came up with a simple 3 step process to restore your backups.

1. Run for president of the United States
2. Get elected
3. Retrieve backup

Known issues
-------------
##### I received an error message that my email size is exceeding the allowed limit
Don't worry. Due to technical restrictions with legacy email systems this error might be raised when you send very large backups. You can safely ignore this message since your files got stored before they hit the actual mail server.
